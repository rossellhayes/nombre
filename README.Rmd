> `nombre`: package to convert numbers to their names in R

**nombre** converts numeric vectors to character vectors of English words.
You can use it to express numbers as cardinals (one, two, three) or ordinals (first, second, third), as well as numerators and denominators. **nombre** supports not just whole numbers, but also negatives and fractions.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **nombre** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nombre")
```

or the development version from GitHub with:

``` {r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rossellhayes/nombre")
```

## Usage

```{r include = FALSE}
library(nombre)
```

**nombre** converts numerics into words:

```{r}
nom_card(2)
nom_card(2L)
x <- rep(TRUE, 525600)
nom_card(length(x))
```

It also works for numeric vectors:

```{r}
nom_card(8^(1:10))
```

**nombre** can also generate ordinals, adverbials, collectives, numerators and denominators:

```{r}
nom_ord(1:5)
nom_adv(1:5)
nom_coll(1:5)
nom_numer(1:5)
nom_denom(1:5)
nom_denom(1:5, numerator = 1:5)
```

> `r emo::ji("shushing")` (numerators are almost always the same as cardinals)

You can also add ordinal suffixes to numerics or arbitrary number-like strings:

```{r}
nom_ord(1:5, cardinal = FALSE)
nom_ord(c("n", "dozen", "umpteen", "eleventy", "one zillion"))
```

It can also handle less common numerics, like negatives and fractions:

```{r}
nom_card(-2)
nom_card(99.9)
```

## Advantages `r emo::ji("rocket")`

**nombre** is implemented using vectorized base R.
This allows it to run faster than options that implement their own object class, like [**english**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=english):

```{r}
bench::mark(nom_card(1:1000), as.character(english::english(1:1000)))
```

**nombre** does not depend on any other packages, making it lightweight to
include in your package.
